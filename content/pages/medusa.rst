Medusa
******
:order: 400

Medusa is a small computational cluster used for neuroscience research by a
hardy cohort of scientists at the `Institute of Psychology II`_ at the
`Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg`_.

Maintained by Alex Waite, Medusa is tailored to the analysis needs of psychology
researchers â€” running `Debian Linux`_ with additional research software provided
by `NeuroDebian`_

When you first use Medusa, you will use one machine: the head node.  However,
Medusa is a collection of servers, with many dedicated computational nodes. In
order to use Medusa to its full potential, you will need to become familiar with
our job scheduler, `Condor <{filename}medusa/condor.rst>`_.
