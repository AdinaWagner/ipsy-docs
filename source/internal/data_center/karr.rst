Karr (neurodebian.ovgu.de) is largely left undocumented since most of its inner workings
are the collective crazed technical ramblings of the NeuroDebian team.

Management
==========
VM level management is done with the `vSphere Web Client`_. Access is through campus
credentials, and current only I (Alex) have access. The URZ can grant additional access.
