Setup your Environment
**********************
There are many things you can do to customize your environment on Medusa; too many
to list here -- or anywhere. But there are Medusa-specific things to note.

Email setup
===========
Condor can notify you about errors, status updates, completed jobs, etc via email.
To enable this useful functionality, create a ``.forward`` file in your home directory.
The file should contain the email address that you want your messages delivered to. 

Make sure that the email address is correct, otherwise the Medusa Admins will get angry calls
from the University IT guys.
