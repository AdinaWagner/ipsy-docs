  "Computers are like Old Testament gods; lots of rules, and no mercy."|br|
  — Joseph Campbell

Before you ask someone for help, be sure that you have done the following:

* If there's an error message: read it. Though sometimes cryptic, all contain
  information that can help you to understand what's happening.
* Think about the task you're trying to perform, and as many of the
  behind-the-scenes steps and parts involved as possible. Consider how the error
  fits into that stack. *Which* part of the system is throwing the error: your
  script, another command, the language, the file system, the network?
* If the error message isn't immediately helpful, search for it using a search
  engine.
* Read the documentation and/or man page. Perhaps what you think you're doing is
  not *actually* what the command is doing.

If you have considered the above, and both your insight and search-fu are
failing you, then it's likely time to ask someone else for help.

When asking for help, be sure to provide the person the following information:

* Clearly describe what you're trying to do
* Provide the error message (if any)
* Explain what you've already done to fix/understand this

A good rule of thumb is that the amount of effort you put into
understanding/solving a problem is the maximum effort that the other
person will invest. Put more pointedly: if your description is that "it doesn't
work", you should fully expect no response — as their response-effort precisely
matches the effort you've invested into explaining your problem.

When you are met with the answer, make sure that you are engaged with it — and
understand it. The goal here is not just to fix your immediate problem. It's to
build a body of knowledge and the skill of troubleshooting. This all culminates
at the end-goal: computers should be tools which empower you — rather than
something inflicted upon you.
