Backup Policy
*************
For the cluster and all servers, `backups are performed daily <{filename}medusa/backups.rst>`_.

For laptops and desktops, there is no centralized backup process. It is your
responsibility to come up with a solution that meets your needs.

As examples, some users...
 * sync a folder to their account on Medusa
 * backup their machines to an external hard drive (i.e. Time Machine)
 * sync with DropBox/Google Drive
 * just don't have important data on their machines

Setting Up Email
****************
The URZ has `email instructions`_ available to help you configure your email
client/app.

Remote Access to OvGU
*********************
You will need to use VPN if you wish to access OvGU's licensing servers or
journal subscriptions while off-campus.

The URZ has `VPN instructions`_ available.

On macOS, the built-in Cisco VPN is more convenient than the official Cisco
client recommended by the URZ.

* Go to `System Preferences` -> `Network`
* Click the `+` symbol in the lower-left corner

  - Interface: "VPN"
  - VPN Type: "Cisco IPSec"
  - Service Name: "OvGU VPN"

* Back in the main network window

  - Server Address: "vpn.ovgu.de"
  - Account Name: <your ovgu account> (the same one to authenticate for email)

* Click on `Authentication Settings`

  - Shared Secret: "vpn1"
  - Group Name: "vpn1"

Software Licensing
******************
`Martin Krippl`_ is responsible for IPSY proprietary software licensing. He's
the one to talk to if you need Office, EndNote, Matlab, SPSS, etc.

Hardware Recommendations
************************
Alex Waite can help you if you have questions about the fit of a given hardware
solution or need help coming up with the specs for a new hardware purchase.

Once determined, you will need to work with the secretary responsible for your
lab. They can best guide you through the purchasing process and inform you of
any strings that may be attached with the available funds.

Updating Website Content
************************
The websites for IPSY and most of its labs use OvGU's official Content
Management System. Information about how to update content in their system can
be found at `cms.ovgu.de`_.

If the content you want to add doesn't need to be on the main website, then
perhaps your `personal webspace on kumo`_ would be a good fit.
