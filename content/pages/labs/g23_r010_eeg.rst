Overview
  The lab has 2 cabins for EEG experiments. Each cabin has its own KVM matrix
  which allows for an incredible amount of flexibility in the set-up of
  experiments; including running an experiment with dual cabin EEG. The cabins
  are sound proof Faraday cages.

Cabin 1
  The setup of cabin 1 includes eye tracking.

Cabin 2
  The setup of cabin 2 includes pain stimulation, current designs box
