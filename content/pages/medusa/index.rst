******************
User Documentation
******************
Welcome to Medusa! The Medusa cluster is a Debian Linux based computational
cluster with (as of January 2016) one head node (medusa), one data node, eleven
compute nodes (snakes), and one backup node.

It is important to read the documentation in order to familiarize yourself with
user policies and the tools used on Medusa.

Before we jump in though, be aware that you are welcome (and encouraged) to
correct, update, and improve these documents. The website sources are written in
ReStructuredText_ (reST) and stored in a Git repository::

  me@somewhere:~$ git clone me@medusa.ovgu.de:/home/git/www.medusa.ovgu.de

If you do not know git and/or reST (and don't care to learn), simply email your
contribution to a Medusa admin.
