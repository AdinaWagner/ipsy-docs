\noindent With my signature I acknowledge that I was informed about the
following policies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The cluster is used by multiple labs/groups, and all existing resources
    are shared by all users. Resources (e.g. memory, storage space) that are not
    required for a particular task need to be made available to other users
    immediately.
  \item Sensitive information (on participants/patients) is stored on the
    cluster. These data are confidential and must be treated as such.
    Users must not access others' data without explicit permission. This includes
    transfer to external storage.
  \item Users receive an account that allows access from any machine connected
    to the Internet. All users are required to maintain a sufficiently secure
    password (e.g. combination of letters, digits, and special characters).
    User must not share their account with any third party.
    Any signs of potential mis-use of accounts must be reported immediately.
  \item Users are required to report any malfunction of the cluster immediately.
    Reports should be directed to the system adminstrator or supervisor in
    charge.

\end{itemize}
