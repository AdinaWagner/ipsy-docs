How to Behave on Medusa
***********************

Simply put:
 * play nicely in the sandbox with others
 * sharing is caring

Fill out your "account application" form for Medusa.

  You should have received and signed an account application form -- detailing
  expectations and policies -- for medusa. If not, please contact a Medusa
  admin.

Do not use storage space unless you really need it

  Storage space is a shared resources for all users. To allow for maximum
  flexibility, there are no user quotas. Please be considerate regarding your
  disk space usage so as to not cause trouble for other users. Take the time to
  regularly remove obsolete data and temporary files.

Do not use the compute nodes directly

  The proper way to use the cluster is to **always** use `Condor <condor>`_.
  While it is possible to log into any of the compute nodes directly via SSH,
  this functionality is only provided to ease troubleshooting efforts -- and
  nothing else. Only by using Condor can the optimal and fair distribution of
  resources and job scheduling be guaranteed. Directly executing jobs on nodes
  is akin to sabotaging other people's work; don't do it.

Report strange/faulty behavior

  If you notice something strange while working with Medusa, please take the
  time to report it. If software or hardware is not working properly, it likely
  affects other users too.
