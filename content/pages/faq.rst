What Is the Backup Policy?
--------------------------
For the cluster and all server, `backups are performed daily <{filename}medusa/backups.rst>`_.

For laptops and desktops, there is no centralized backup process. It is your
responsibility to come up with a solution that meets your needs.

As examples, some users...
 * sync a folder to their account on medusa
 * backup their machines to an external hard drive (i.e. Time Machine)
 * sync with DropBox/Google Drive
 * just don't have important data on their machines

Setting Up an Email Client
--------------------------
The URZ has `email instructions`_ available.

Accessing OvGU's Network Remotely
---------------------------------
The URZ has `VPN instructions`_ available.

On macOS, the built-in Cisco VPN is more convenient than the official Cisco
client that the URZ recommends.

  * Go to `System Preferences` -> `Network`
  * Click the `+` symbol in the lower-left corner

    - Interface: "VPN"
    - VPN Type: "Cisco IPSec"
    - Service Name: "OvGU VPN"
  * Back in the main network window

    - Server Address: "vpn.ovgu.de"
    - Account Name: <your ovgu account> (the same one to authenticate for email)
  * Click on `Authentication Settings`

    - Shared Secret: "vpn1"
    - Group Name: "vpn1"

You can also check `Show VPN status in menu bar` to make it more convenient to
connect and disconnect from VPN.

--------------------------------
Martin Krippl is responsible for IPSY proprietary software licensing. If you

Updating Content on the Website
-------------------------------
IPSY and most labs use OvGU's official Content Management System. Information
about how to update content in their system can be found at cms.ovgu.de.

If the content you want to add doesn't need to be on the main website, then
perhaps your ``personal webspace on kumo`` would be a good fit.
